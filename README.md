In this repository, you can find and download the datasets used for the model implementation and fitting for the 2013 Chikungunya outbreak in the Caribbean Region.

In 2013, the Caribbean underwent an unprecedented epidemic of Chikungunya that affected 29 islands and mainland territories throughout the Caribbean in the first 6 months. In the model we analyze the spatio-temporal spread of the outbreak among the Caribbean islands, showing that the initial patterns of the epidemic can be explained by a simple network model based on the flight connections among islands. The flight connection network does not follow a random graph model. Its topology is likely the product of geo-political relationships that generate increased connectedness among locations sharing the same language. 

The infection is propagated preferentially among islands that belong to the same cultural domain, irrespective of their human and vector population densities. The model shows how a simple epidemic coupled with an appropriate human mobility model can reproduce the observed epidemiological dynamics. 

The files you can download from this repository are the following:
